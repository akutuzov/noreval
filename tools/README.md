## Additional tools for NorEval

### Task groups

See the `groups/` directory. The NorEval tasks are grouped by their nature and by their evaluation metrics (to ease aggregation).
Other groupings are, of course, possible.

### Processing and visualizing results

The `process_results.py` takes as an input a directory with the output of `lm_eval_harness` and produces informative plots on comparative models performance in the chosen task groups.
