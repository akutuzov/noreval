"David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to ""Green Boots""; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.[144] Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,[150] and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.[6]"	"Breaking news: International controversy has sprung up after British climber David Sharp was reported dead while on a solo climb to the top of Mount Everest on 15 May. The story has apparently grown beyond the scope of the mountaineering community as many have been interviewed by the media. Allegations and critiques have come from many sources. Have climbers in the 2006 season left a man to die when he still had a chance to be saved? Sources say that Sharp tried to climb the mountain by himself with no guides, and it's said he even brought fewer oxygen bottles than normal. His guide firm in Nepal was a low-budget service that provided him service as far as Base Camp, but after that point, they expect climbers to continue as a ""loose group,"" which allows for a great deal of independence. The manager told us that Sharp didn't have enough oxygen with him for his climb and chose not to have a Sherpa guide. The question is who knew that Sharp was in trouble? If they did know, were they even qualified or capable of helping him? 

One fellow climber, a double-amputee named Mark Inglis, claims that his party, along with several others, passed Sharp on their trek. He was reportedly sheltering beneath a rock overhang that was 450 metres below the summit, but none attempted a rescue. Inglis also said that 40 people had passed Sharp, but they might not have noticed him and instead thought he was the corpse nicknamed ""Green Boots."" What Inglis didn't know was that a party of Turkish climbers did try to help Sharp, even though they were already helping an injured woman (Turkish Burçak Poçan). Himex has also been discussed in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. It's interesting to note that Inglis later revises his story, claiming that at the time he was first interviewed, he was ""...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite--he later had five fingertips amputated."" A search of Sharp's possessions found a receipt for US$7,490 which is thought to be his entire cost for the climb. Most expeditions cost between $35,000 and $100,000, not to mention an additional $20,000 in other expenses like gear and bonuses. It is believed that Sharp summited on 14 May before beginning his descent, but on 15 May he encountered trouble. At this point, he was being passed by other climbers, and it's believed that he was experiencing hypoxia at around 300 metres from the summit.

Beck Weathers, who participated in the 1996 Mount Everest expedition that ended in disaster, claims that those who are dying tend to be left behind. Apparently, he had been left for dead himself on two separate occasions but had been able to keep walking and save himself. The Tribune of Chandigarh, India describes Sharp's predicament as ""the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering."" Nine other climbers also died in 2006, including Sherpas working for guide firms. 

The Discovery Channel captures a lot of the controversy in their television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. One very important piece of  Sharp's story is shown in the program when an early-returning climber named Maxim Chaya radioed his base camp manager (Russell Brice) to say that he had found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya couldn't identify Sharp because he had chosen to not identify himself to other climbers. Instead of sending help, the base camp manager assumed that Sharp was a member of a group that had already abandoned him. He told Chaya that he wouldn't be able to help Sharp on his own, so Chaya left him. Sharp's condition continued to worsen and his chances of rescue grew smaller as climbers continue to pass him in their descent. The frostbite was making his legs and feet curl, preventing him from walking, and later descending climbers were low on oxygen and strength themselves. As the day continued, time ran out for Sherpas to come back and rescue him. 

Sharp's body remained where it was, just below the summit on the Chinese side, next to ""Green Boots."" They shared a small rock cave that also acted as their tomb. The BBC reports that Sharp's body was removed in 2007, and Green Boots has been missing since 2014, likely moved or buried."
Rewrite this interview as a short horror story.	"Let’s end on a happy note. Are you quitting school now you’re 18?
No, I’m still studying. I’m going to the University of Nebraska which is for high school students who travel. I don’t have a tutor on the road with me and I used to get really upset ’cos I had to learn algebra and geometry and everything myself and it was really, really hard. All the dancers were mucking around doing whatever on the bus and I was just sitting there with my books!"	"It was a little after midnight when the phone rang. She answered, sleepy but curious. A low, menacing voice on the other end asked, ""Now that you're 18, are your thoughts turning to marriage and stuff like that?""
 
She tried to shake off the chill that ran down her spine. ""Who is this?"" she demanded.
 
The voice cackled. ""Marriage? Oh yes, we'll definitely be together someday. You, me, and our three children in a big, beautiful home. And you'll still want to go out and perform, won't you? But when you have kids, I'll see to it that you never leave them.""
 
She felt her heart racing as the voice continued, ""And that man at your party—Robbie Carrico? Is he a potential husband? Don't lie to me.""
 
Trembling with fear, she whispered, ""No, he's just a friend...""
 
The voice snarled, ""I know you're lying. You'll never be happy with anyone else but me.""
 
She tried to protest, but the voice cut her off. ""And don't think you can date casually like other teens. Once I find you, I'll never let you go. You'll be mine forever.""
 
Her mind raced with terror as the voice spoke of Billie Piper, whose fans had turned on her after she fell in love. ""If you ever fall in love,"" the voice hissed, ""you'll regret it.""
 
As the call ended, she quivered in the darkness, knowing she could never escape the haunting figure watching her every move. She would never outrun the fear that followed her every step."
Turn this into a poem	"The Barbarossa Brothers
Sailing from North Africa’s Barbary Coast, the Barbarossa (which means “red beard” in Italian) brothers Aruj and Hizir became rich by capturing European vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. Though their most lucrative early victims included two papal galleys and a Sardinian warship, they began targeting the Spanish around the time Aruj lost an arm to them in battle. By 1516 the Ottoman sultan had essentially put Aruj in charge of the entire Barbary Coast, a position that Hizir took over two years later following his brother’s death. Hizir, otherwise known as Khair-ed-Din, then spent the rest of his days fighting various Christian enemies, including a “Holy League” fleet specifically formed by the pope to destroy him."	"On North Africa's Barbary shore,
The Barbarossa brothers sailed and more.
Aruj and Hizir, with red beards so bold,
Captured European ships, their treasures to behold.

Papal galleys and Sardinian might,
Their early conquests brought fortune's light.
But as Aruj lost an arm in the Spanish fray,
Their focus turned, vengeance their way.

By 1516, the Ottoman sultan's decree,
Put Aruj in charge, ruler of the sea.
Hizir, Khair-ed-Din, the brother's name,
After Aruj's passing, he stepped into fame.

Christian foes and Holy League's might,
They battled against, with valor and might.
Enemies abound, their resolve was true,
The Barbarossa brothers, a legend they grew.

Their story echoes through the ages past,
Pirates of the Barbary, their legacy vast.
From red beards to battles, a pirate's tale,
The Barbarossa brothers, their names prevail."
Write this from the point of view of a haughty dragon.	D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, also referred to as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.[3][7][11]	"You see, D&D is no mere traditional wargame, it allows each player to create their own individual character (doomed to be eaten by a powerful dragon such as myself), rather than playing a military formation (not that an army would save you from my jaws). These pitiful characters embark upon ""adventures"" within the fantasy setting, the best ones featuring dragons, of course. A Dungeon Master (DM for short) serves as something of the game's referee or storyteller, maintaining the world in which the adventures happen, and also playing the role of NPC's, or non-player characters (who more often than not are servants to powerful dragons, as they should be). Trying their best, the player characters form groups and interact with the setting's characters and each other. Together, they try to solve problems, fight battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge (things we dragons have in spades, the perfect lure for foolish adventurers to meet the jaws of powerful dragons). While doing this, these feeble characters then earn experience points (XP for short), to level up, getting stronger over several gaming sessions (only to meet their demise from dragon breath, the fate of all foolish adventurers)."
Rewrite this love letter as a breakup letter.	Happy Birthday Princess, we get old and get used to each other. We think alike. We read each other’s minds. We know what the other wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each a little bit. Maybe sometimes take each other for granted. But once in awhile, like today, I meditate on it and realise how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met. You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You’re the object of my desire, the #1 Earthly reason for me existence. I love you very much.	"I know today is your special day, but I've been thinking about our relationship. We've gotten older and are used to each other's presence, thinking the same way and reading each other's minds.

While sometimes we know what the other wants without asking, we also irritate and take each other for granted.
 
As I meditate on our journey, I realize our connection has faded. You were once my greatest inspiration and the #1 reason for my existence. But things have changed, and it's time for us to go our separate ways.
 
I want you to know that I'll never forget the good times we had together, and I hope you find happiness in the future."
